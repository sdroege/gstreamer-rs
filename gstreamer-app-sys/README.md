# gstreamer-sys [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gstreamer-sys.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gstreamer-sys) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdroege/gstreamer-sys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdroege/gstreamer-sys)

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) (App library) FFI bindings for Rust.

These bindings are providing unsafe FFI API that can be used to interface with
GStreamer. Generally they are meant to be used as the building block for
higher-level abstractions like:

  * Application-side bindings for GStreamer: https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs
  * Crate for writing GStreamer plugins in Rust: https://github.com/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs

The bindings are autogenerated with [gir](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/)
based on the [GObject-Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/)
API metadata provided by the GStreamer project.
